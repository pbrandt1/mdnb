# Basics

Tables look like this:

| value | explanation |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | it means nothing |
| 2 | the number of times you should brush your teeth every day. at least |
| 7 | this number is kindof angular looking |

Here are all the headings

# H1 Heading For Very Important Things

## H2 Heading Still Looks Very Important

### H3 Might Be Too Much

#### H4 For When You Love Typing The &#35; Sign

##### H5 Is This Even A Thing?

###### H6 Why Would You Ever Need This?

ok that was fun.

Add `---` or `<hr>` wherever. It looks like a page break.

here I am on the other side of the hr.

I hear you lke lists. Feast your eyes on THESE puppies.

- Roses are red
- Violets are blue
- Engineers think in bulleted lists
  1. And numbered sublists, too

Links look like [this](https://example.com).

code looks like `this` and

```c
int main() {
    printf("%s", "THIS");
}
```

Blockquotes

> The readings that came from our exquisite accelerometers did not actually measure acceleration, it seemed; they measured the net velocity change since the previous reading two seconds before. That was not the same thing, especially when, part way through that two second period, the actual acceleration was changed by the previous throttle command...
> As for mass, I looked around to see where that was being calculated -- and found to my surprise that it was not. The LM's mass at the start of the mission was known, but that was only a starting point because the spacecraft steadily became lighter as it burned fuel. Suddenly I was not just building a throttle controller, I was building a mass estimator.
