**Blockquotes**

> The readings that came from our exquisite accelerometers did not actually measure acceleration, it seemed; they measured the net velocity change since the previous reading two seconds before. That was not the same thing, especially when, part way through that two second period, the actual acceleration was changed by the previous throttle command...
>
> As for mass, I looked around to see where that was being calculated -- and found to my surprise that it was not. The LM's mass at the start of the mission was known, but that was only a starting point because the spacecraft steadily became lighter as it burned fuel. Suddenly I was not just building a throttle controller, I was building a mass estimator.
